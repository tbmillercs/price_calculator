# Grocery Store Price Calculator
Price calculator tool for Maxwell Interview Exercise #2.

This tool accepts a user's input of product names in any order and prints out a receipt containing the products
purchased, quantity purchased, individual prices, total price, and amount saved.

# Dependencies
This tool was written using Ruby 2.7.2 on Ubuntu 20.04 and it requires the 'yaml' and 'money' gems. While it
will likely work on other versions of Ruby and other operating systems, I did not have the tools to verify this.

# Execution
```
# Gems can be installed manually or simply run
> bundle install

# Execute the main code
> ruby price_calculator.rb
```
